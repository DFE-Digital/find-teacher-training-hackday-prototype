# Find postgraduate teacher training (hackday prototype)

This prototype is based on the [GOV.UK prototype kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit)

This prototype is a sister project to the main [Find postgraduate teacher training prototype](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/find-teacher-training-prototype). It exists to explore what the Find postgraduate teacher training (Find) service might look like following ITT reform.
